After Neuro sends an action command, your game should return back the following packet to tell Neuro if the command succeeded:

```ts
{
	"command": "action/result",
	"game": string,
	"data": {
		"id": string,
		"success": boolean,
		"message"?: string
	}
}
```

<Aside type="caution">

You shouldn't be sending multiple action results, you should only be sending one per action command.

</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">

You should send back the result as soon as possible, to tell Neuro whether or not she entered the action details correctly.
If you need to do an action that requires a bit of wait time, [use the asynchronous action result technique](/neuro-sdk-docs/base/techniques/asynchronous_action_results).

</Aside>

## `data` Parameters

- `id` - The ID of the action you are sending the result of. This should have been sent to you from Neuro when she executed an `action` command.
- `success` - Whether or not the action succeeded.

<Aside type="danger">

If the action was part of an `actions/force` _and_ `success` is set to `false`, Neuro will **retry the whole action force**! That means that she may retry with completely different data or even with a different action!

If the action failed but you don't want Neuro to retry the force, set `success` to `true` but provide an error message in the `message` field.

</Aside>

- `message` - A short, optional (required if `success` is `false`) string that gets received by Neuro.
