Proposals are adjustments to the API specs that are planned, but not implemented. Because these aren't implemented yet, the current version of Neuro don't use these APIs.
In addition, SDKs and simulators vary in terms of supporting these APIs. For that reason, games shouldn't be relying or needing to support these APIs until they are confirmed to now be in the current specs.

Here are the list of current proposals:

</CardGrid>
