    This site is under <b>heavy WIP</b>, and is currently closed-source.
    You've most likely been pointed to this site to point towards a concept, or something.
    Either way, take at least some of the info on this page with a grain of salt, and also don't expect much info since it's very incomplete on content.

Proposals are adjustments to the API specs that are planned, but not implemented. Because these aren't implemented yet, the current version of Neuro don't use these APIs.
In addition, SDKs and simulators vary in terms of supporting these APIs. For that reason, games shouldn't be relying or needing to support these APIs until they are confirmed to now be in the current specs.

Here are the list of current proposals:
