    This site is under <b>heavy WIP</b>.
    You've most likely been pointed to this site to point towards a concept, or something.
    Either way, take at least some of the info on this page with a grain of salt, and also don't expect much info since it's very incomplete on content.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Upon connection to Neuro, a startup packet must be sent: {/* What happens if this isn't sent? */}

```ts
{
    "command": "startup",
    "game": string
}
```

## Parameters

- `game` - Your game's name, as it's officially displayed and stylised. (examples: Liar's Bar, Minecraft, osu!, Slay the Spire, Buckshot Roulette, Pok√©mon Showdown!) {/* Is it safe to use characters with special symbols (e.g. umlauts, accents)? */}

<Aside type="caution">

Upon sending this packet, Neuro will automatically unregister all actions currently registered.

You shouldn't send this packet more than once either, as it also does some behind-the-scenes setup.
