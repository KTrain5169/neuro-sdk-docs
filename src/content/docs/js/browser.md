In addition to being available as a module published on the npm registry, you can also get it by using `<script>` tags in your `<body>`.

Simply place this as a `<script>` tag somewhere in your body:

```html
<\!-- Using unpkg -\->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/neuro-game-sdk/dist/browser/neuro-game-sdk.min.js"></script>

<\!-- Using jsDelivr -\->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/neuro-game-sdk/dist/browser/neuro-game-sdk.min.js"></script>
```

And congrats! You now have the Neuro Game SDK in your browser that you can use.
