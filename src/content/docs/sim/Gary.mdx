Gary (aka Gaming Gary™️) is a Neuro simulator written in Python. Gary allows you to use models downloaded onto your computer for testing Neuro Game API integrations.

Gary is maintained by Govorunb, and can be found [here](https://github.com/Govorunb/gary).

<Aside type="caution">

Gary, due to using local models, has varying performance depending on your computer's specs.
While it has the potential to be better than Jippity if you have great specs, it can also be _worse than Randy_ if you have not as good specs.

If your specs aren't normally good for running AI, you might want to use [Randy](/sim/randy), [Jippity](/sim/jippity), or [Tony](/sim/tony).

## Setup

<Aside>

This part assumes you already have Python installed.

If you don't have Python, [download the official distribution here](https://python.org/download).

</Aside>

<Steps>

1. Clone Gary into a folder:

   <Code code="git clone https://github.com/Govorunb/gary" lang="sh" />

2. `cd` into it and sync the uv lockfile:
   ```sh
   cd gary
   uv sync
   ```
3. Run the uv command:

   ```sh
   uv run gary
   ```

   <Aside type="caution">

   Gary does not come with models by default. See [Configuration - Before startup](#Before%20startup) for potential areas to get models from.

</Steps>

## Configuration

### Before startup

Gary does not come with any models by default. As such, you'll need to download a model yourself to use.
