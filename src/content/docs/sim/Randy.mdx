Randy (aka Random Dot Range) is a JavaScript Neuro simulator that makes random choices when forced to do an action. This can be useful as a basic, low-latency testing tool to test your integrations.

You can also tell Randy to do an action by itself using a POST request to its HTTP endpoint.

Randy is maintained by alexvoid, and can be found [here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/tree/main/Randy).

## Setup

<Aside>

This part assumes you have a standalone JavaScript runtime engine.

If you don't have a JavaScript runtime engine, [download Node.js here](https://nodejs.org/download).

</Aside>

To set up Randy:

<Steps>

1. Clone the Neuro Game SDK repo:

   <Code
     code="git clone https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk.git"
     lang="sh"
   />

2. Navigate into the `Randy` subdirectory:

   <Code code="cd neuro-game-sdk/Randy" lang="sh" />

3. Install dependencies using your package manager:

   <Tabs syncKey="js-package-manager">
     <TabItem label="npm">
       <Code code="npm install" lang="sh" />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="yarn">
       <Code code="yarn install" lang="sh" />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pnpm">
       <Code code="pnpm install" lang="sh" />
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

4. Start Randy using:

   <Tabs syncKey="js-package-manager">
     <TabItem label="npm">
       <Code code="npm run start" lang="sh" />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="yarn">
       <Code code="yarn run start" lang="sh" />
     </TabItem>
     <TabItem label="pnpm">
       <Code code="pnpm run start" lang="sh" />
     </TabItem>
   </Tabs>

</Steps>

## Startup

On startup, Randy occupies ports 8000 (WebSocket) and 1337 (HTTP) and will begin listening for packets.

Randy will immediately respond to `actions/force` packets with a random selection and mock data for the schema (if one is required). Otherwise, Randy will not respond or react to any packets (other than the registration and unregistration of actions).

If desired, you can make a POST request to Randy's HTTP port to simulate Neuro manually selecting an action using the following example:

<Code code={cURLexample} lang="sh" title="UNIX cURL" />

## Known issues

- Randy sometimes won't let go of his HTTP port when closing. You can fix this with the following command:

<Tabs syncKey="js-package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm">
    <Code code="npx kill-port 1337" lang="sh" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    <Code code="yarn dlx kill-port 1337" lang="sh" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    <Code
      code={`pnpx kill-port 1337\n# or\npnpm dlx kill-port 1337`}
      lang="sh"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
