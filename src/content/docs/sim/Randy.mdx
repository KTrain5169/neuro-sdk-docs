Randy (aka Random Dot Range) is a JavaScript Neuro simulator that makes random choices when forced to do an action. This can be useful as a basic, low-latency testing tool to test your integrations.

You can also tell Randy to do an action by itself using a POST request to its HTTP endpoint.

Randy is maintained by Alex, and can be found [here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/tree/main/Randy).

## Startup

On startup, Randy occupies ports 8080 (WebSocket) and 1337 (HTTP) and will begin listening for packets.

Randy will immediately respond to `actions/force` packets with a random selection and mock data for the schema (if one is required). Otherwise, Randy will not respond or react to any packets (other than the registration and unregistration of actions).

If desired, you can make a POST request to Randy's HTTP port to simulate Neuro manually selecting an action using the following example:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:1337/ \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "command": "action",
    "data": {
        "id": "blegh",
        "name": "join_friend_lobby",
        "data": "{\"friend_name\": \"jerma985\"}"
    }
}'
```

## Known issues

- Randy sometimes won't let go of his HTTP port when closing. You can fix this with the following command:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">
  <TabItem label="npm">
    <Code code="npx kill-port 1337" lang="sh" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    <Code code="yarn dlx kill-port 1337" lang="sh" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    <Code
      code={`pnpx kill-port 1337\n# or\npnpm dlx kill-port 1337`}
      lang="sh"
    />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
