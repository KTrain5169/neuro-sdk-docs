    You've most likely been pointed to this site to point towards a concept, or something.
    Either way, take at least some of the info on this page with a grain of salt, and also don't expect much info since it's very incomplete on content.

The Web Game Runner is a tool written in Python that allows you to host server files for a web game. It can be used to test your WebGL games with Godot/Unity, or when testing with the JavaScript SDK (in some circumstances).

The tool is maintained by alexvoid, and can be located [here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/tree/main/Web%20Game%20Runner).
