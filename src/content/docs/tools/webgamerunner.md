title: Web Game Runner
---

The Web Game Runner is a tool written in Python that allows you to host server files for a web game. It can be used to test your WebGL games with Godot/Unity, or when testing with the JavaScript SDK (in some circumstances).

The tool is maintained by Alex, and can be located [here](https://github.com/VedalAI/neuro-game-sdk/tree/main/Web%20Game%20Runner).
